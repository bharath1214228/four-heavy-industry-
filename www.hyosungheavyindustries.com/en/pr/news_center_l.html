							Chairman Cho Hyun-joon Pledges to Invest KRW 1 trillion in Green Hydrogen in Jeollanam-do</h2>
						<p class="lp-body" data-ellipsis="5">
							&nbsp;Following the chairman Cho Hyun-joon′s decision to develop the Honam region into  the business group′s outpost for future business, Hyosung has started to  construct a large-scale advanced materials production plant in Jeollabuk-do and  pledged to build core infrastructure for the green energy industry in  Jeollanam-do.  □ Chairman Cho Hyun-joon: ″We will create a green energy mecca by mobilizing  all our business capabilities.″On January 24th, Chairman Cho signed an MOU  with Jeollanam-do to ′foster the green hydrogen industry′ in the  province.Under the agreement, Chairman Cho will take the lead in creating  jobs for about 300,000 people and producing 200,000 tons of green hydrogen  through offshore wind power generation in and around Sinan-gun in collaboration  with Jeollanam-do. The signing ceremony was attended by Hyosung Chairman Cho  Hyun-joon and Vice Chairman Lee Sang-woon and Jeollanam-do Governor Kim Yung-rok  and Kim Shin-nam, director of the Bureau of Economy and Energy of the province.  Chairman Cho said, "We will mobilize all of our group′s technology and  expertise that we have accumulated over the years in the fields of hydrogen  business, heavy electric equipment, and new and renewable energy in order to  help create an offshore wind power generation complex in Jeollanam-do  successfully. We will contribute to making Jeonnam a mecca for the green energy  industry in Korea.″Governor Kim Yung-rok said, ″I highly appreciate  Hyosung′s strong commitment to the hydrogen industry,″ noting, ″We will work  together to realize the vision of Jeollanam-do to become a green hydrogen mecca  based on its large-scale offshore wind power generation while empowering Hyosung  to become a global top-tier company in the hydrogen life cycle at the same  time.″ □ ″To produce 200,000 tons of green hydrogen using renewable energy such as  wind power″Hyosung is planning to invest a total of KRW 1 trillion in the  production of green hydrogen using renewable energy in the mid- to long-term  based on a water electrolysis method that produces clean green hydrogen by  electrolyzing water with electricity generated from wind power off the coast of  Jeollanam-do.To this end, Hyosung will kick off a project to build a  10MW-class water electrolysis facility, the largest in Korea, in 2022. The  company is planning to expand its production of green hydrogen to a maximum of  200,000 tons per year.Hyosung is aiming to supply its green hydrogen to  major industrial complexes in the Seoul Metropolitan Area, Ulsan, Changwon, and  Busan, with some of the clean energy exported to a few foreign countries  including Japan.To facilitate the storage and utilization of green hydrogen,  Hyosung has decided to build two liquid hydrogen plants with an annual capacity  of 10,000 tons and install liquid hydrogen charging stations in nine major areas  across Jeollanam-do. The company is also planning to promote the complete  vertical integration of the green hydrogen industry by conducting the shipping  of liquid hydrogen on its own. In addition, Hyosung is preparing to promote  the production and utilization of blue hydrogen by applying the CCUS (Carbon  Capture Utilization and Storage) technology to by-product hydrogen generated  from industrial complexes in Jeollanam-do.It is estimated that Hyosung will  be able to create about 110,000 jobs by 2031 from its full-force production of  green hydrogen in Jeollanam-do, serving as a catalyst for economic  revitalization in the entire Honam region which includes Jeollabuk-do.  □ Jeollanam-do to build wind power generation facilities equivalent to 25  nuclear power plantsHyosung has decided to actively participate in renewable  energy projects such as wind power to generate electricity for green hydrogen  production facilities.With President Moon Jae-in in attendance, Jeollanam-do  announced last February that it would build the world′s largest 8.2GW offshore  wind farm in Sinan by 2030 in addition to a 5GW offshore wind power generation  complex that will be built in eastern Jeollanam-do centered on Yeosu, making the  province a leader in the country′s transition to decarbonization and green  energy.For the creation of offshore wind power complexes in Sinan and Yeosu,  .Jeollanam-do is promoting the construction of wind power assembly plants, docks  and ports as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure, expecting to  create about 200,000 jobs by 2030 in the process alone. The total scale of  offshore wind farms in Jeollanam-do is 25GW, with the wind farms to be built  along a 300-kilometer coastline from Yeonggwang to Yeosu via Sinan being  equivalent to 25 nuclear power plants in terms of power generation  capacity.Jeollanam-do plans to build separate industrial complexes devoted  to the nurturing of upstream and downstream offshore wind power industries in  the Mokpo Daeyang Industrial Complex, Yeongam Daebul Industrial Complex, and  Sinan Aphae Industrial Complex. The province is also planning to develop a  hinterland complex over the land of about 520,000m2 in Mokpo New Port which will  serve as a hydrogen industrial cluster that can meet all the needs of its  offshore wind power generation.  □ Hyosung to build an offshore wind power assembly plantIn line with  Jeollanam-do′s offshore wind power generation plan, Hyosung will kick off the  construction of an offshore wind power assembly plant in Jeollanam-do by 2023.  Hyosung Heavy Industries is getting ready to establish a joint venture with  the third largest company in the global offshore wind turbine market in 2022  while promoting to acquire KS certification for its 10MW class offshore wind  turbine to be produced in Korea.It also actively participates in various  power grid construction projects required for offshore wind power generation.  For the power grid construction project worth around KRW 19 trillion won,  Hyosung expects to supply HVDC (high-voltage direct current) systems tailored to  increase the transmission efficiency of new and renewable energy as well as  various transmission and distribution power equipment such as ultra-high voltage  transformers and circuit breakers Hyosung also anticipates that it will be  in a position to supply a large volume of STATCOM (Static Synchronous  Compensator) and ESS (Energy Storage System) required to supply and store  electricity generated by offshore wind farms and solar farms in a stable manner.   □ To invest KRW 1 trillion in Jeollabuk-do to build a production base for  advanced materials such as carbon fibersIn 2019, Chairman Cho announced a  plan to invest a total of KRW 1 trillion to build the world′s largest carbon  fiber plant with an annual capacity of 24,000 tons in Jeonju, Jeollabuk-do by  2028. Hyosung succeeded in developing carbon fibers with its own technology  for the first time in Korea and has produced carbon fibers in Jeonju since 2013.  Through the production facility expansion of the plant made twice, Hyosung will  be equipped with the annual carbon fiber production capacity of 6,500 tons by  July this year. As carbon fiber is ten times stronger than iron but weighs  only a quarter, it is called the rice of the future industry. Recently, it is  used as an essential material for hydrogen fuel tanks, drawing attention as a  high-tech material that will accelerate the transition to a hydrogen economy.  </p>

										Hyosung, which has a major competitive edge over other domestic businesses, plans to build infrastructure for the production, storage, and transportation of liquid hydrogen in Gyeongbuk as it has already done in Ulsan and Jeonnam.On Sept. 27, Hyosung Heavy Industries and the Uljin-gun, Gyeongbuk municipality formed an MOU on a project to develop the nuclear clean hydrogen industry during a ceremony held at the Hyosung’s head office building in Mapo-gu, Seoul with Hyosung Heavy Industries VP Ahn Seong-hoon and Uljin-Gun head Son Byeong-bok, etc. in attendance.The two parties have agreed to cooperate to build the infrastructure geared to robust distribution and use of large-scale clean hydrogen produced through the electricity and heat generated in the process of nuclear power generation in Uljin.&nbsp;In line with the abovementioned, Hyosung Heavy Industries will forge ahead in the following domains in Uljin: △ Construction of liquefied hydrogen plants, △ provision of liquid hydrogen storage facilities and trailers /pipeline for transportation of liquid hydrogen, and △ construction and operation of liquid hydrogen re-filling stations.&nbsp;Uljin-Gun municipality has agreed to provide positive administrative support for the domains Hyosung Heavy Industries plans to pursue and devise a strategy for phased progression of the project.&nbsp;Hyosung Heavy Industries plans to take part in the project for building a national industrial complex for the production of clean hydrogen generated from nuclear power plants, which Uljin-Gun municipality plans to support and promote.The said MOU marks a major accomplishment for Hyosung Heavy Industries by helping it secure its prominence as a leader in the domestic hydrogen business with the expansion of the said program to Gyeongbuk, on the heels of the country’s first liquefied hydrogen facility being built by Hyosung Heavy Industries at its Yongyeon Plant in Ulsan and the green hydrogen production project linked with offshore wind power generation in Jeonnam.&nbsp;In regard to the matter, Hyosung Heavy Industries V.P. Ahn Seong-hoon remarked, “We are highly enthusiastic to assume a leading role in the project for the development of a facility that will produce a large-scale clean hydrogen being advanced by Uljin-Gun municipality. We are committed to charting the way forward in our efforts to invigorate the hydrogen industry based on our technological prowess in liquid hydrogen.”Hyosung Heavy Industries is building a facility that can produce 13,000 tons of liquefied hydrogen a year at its Yongyeon Plant. The project is scheduled to be completed by 2023, and it also plans to build large-sized liquid hydrogen refueling stations, besides those slated to be built in Ulsan, Gwangyang, Geoje, and Gyeongsan.&nbsp;</p>

										Hyosung employees take a fall season trip with the families of children with disabilities<!-- 검색어 class="keyword" -->

									<p class="nl-body" data-ellipsis="2">
										Hyosung employees, together with those from the Purme Foundation, took a fall season trip to places in Gyeonggi-do, being accompanied by the families of young people with disabilities on a three-day schedule from Sept. 23.&nbsp;The said event is part of the programs for rehabilitation treatment of children/young people with disabilities provided jointly by Hyosung and the Purme Foundation. The event held in the fall of 2022 was participated by a total of 51 people among ten families of Hyosung employees and nine families of children/ young people with disabilities. The group (each team consisting of the family of an employee and the family of a person with disabilities) had a good time for two nights &amp; three days.&nbsp;On day 1 (Sept. 23), they saw the sight of a bamboo forest and the place where the popular drama Autumn in my heart was shot on Namiseom Island in Gapyeong. They also had a recreation time to encourage dialogues and communication between participants. On day 2, they paid a visit to a village in Yangpyeong and had a hands-on experience with making sundubu (soft tofu) and injeolmi, and catching trout in the stream. On Day 3, they took part in the event of making tomato gochujang (red pepper paste) and feeding animals, and strolled around inside the Yulbom Botanical Garden in Gwangju.Commenting on the trip, the mother of a disabled child said, “Due to my child’s disability status, we always found it not easy to take a trip with the whole family. This time, we could have a good time and experience a lot of things this time thanks to the well-arranged daily schedule. My child said that he would like to take another trip like this.”&nbsp;A Hyosung employee who took the trip said, “We could teach our kid how to get along with fellow friends with disabilities. We talked to each other a lot and did many activities that will be cherished as a fond memory.”Hyosung, together with the Purme Foundation, has provided support funds for medical rehabilitation of children with disabilities since 2013, along with the support for mental health care and education for siblings of children with disabilities, who are prone to feel alienated due to the need and efforts to take care of their disabled siblings. Last July, the Group arranged for a trip for 15 able-bodied siblings of children with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>

										HHI Set to Develop Areas Left Uncultivated in Namibia’s Power Supply Market<!-- 검색어 class="keyword" -->
									</h2>
									<p class="nl-body" data-ellipsis="2">
										Hyosung Heavy Industries is actively engaged to display a series of noticeable endeavors on the African Continent.On the morning of Sept. 15, Hyosung Heavy Industries formed a contract for installing ultra-high voltage transformers worth KRW 20 billion with state-run NamPower of Namibia at the Hyosung Group head office in Mapo, Seoul. With this, the Company has been awarded contracts for the new installation or expansion of existing ten ultra-high voltage transformers (132kV – 400 kV) from NamPower this year alone, and plans to deliver them by the second half of 2023. The total amount of supply contracts signed by the Company with NamPower this year alone comes to about KRW 31.5 billion. The contract formed this time is notable for highlighting the tangible result of concerted efforts made by the Company to develop power supply markets in Africa.&nbsp;In regard to matter, Director Park Taeyeong in charge of the Company’s new global project sales commented, “Recently, African countries recognize the importance of power supply and continue to modernize their power supply infrastructure. We have strived in earnest to develop these markets, taking a keen interest in them from the pre-COVID-19 era. Now, we are accelerating our concerted efforts to make major strides into the power supply markets of emerging countries on that continent.”&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, Hyosung Heavy Industries has been taking more positive steps for greater business opportunities in Africa including South Africa. The Company has succeeded in winning an order for 400kV transformers to be used in private capital-based renewable energy power supply projects carried out by the South African government. It has also succeeded in winning a project for construction of a substation worth KRW 230 billion from the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo), given the country’s need to modernize its power supply network in the southwestern areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
